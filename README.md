## Current Helm Charts

- [cloudzero-agent](charts/cloudzero-agent/README.md) A chart for using Prometheus in agent mode to send cluster metrics to the CloudZero platform.

## Documentation

Detailed documentation of each helm chart should be available within each chart README.md. Other documentation that may be helpful:
- [CloudZero Docs](https://docs.cloudzero.com/) for general information on CloudZero.
- [Helm Documentation](https://helm.sh/) for information on what Helm is, and how it is used to install artifacts on Kubernetes clusters.
- [Kubernetes Documentation](https://kubernetes.io/docs/home/) for information on Kubernetes itself.

## Installation

The helm charts in this repository generally assume the use of Helm v3 for installation. More detailed installation instructions are located within the README of each chart. For example, the `cloudzero-agent` installation instructions are located [here](https://github.com/Cloudzero/cloudzero-charts/tree/develop/charts/cloudzero-agent#installation). See the [official Helm documentation](https://helm.sh/docs/intro/install/) for instructions on installing Helm v3.

Installation can also be managed by deployment tools such as ArgoCD or Spinnaker if desired, but installation instructions in this repository assume the use of the Helm CLI.

## Testing

Each helm chart should maintain its own [tests](https://helm.sh/docs/topics/chart_tests/). These tests should be executed with the command:
```bash
helm test <chart-name>
```

This is in addition to integration and load tests not managed in this repository.

## What is CloudZero?

CloudZero is the only cloud cost intelligence platform that puts engineering in control by connecting technical decisions to business results.:

- [Cost Allocation And Tagging](https://www.cloudzero.com/tour/allocation) Organize and allocate cloud spend in new ways, increase tagging coverage, or work on showback.
- [Kubernetes Cost Visibility](https://www.cloudzero.com/tour/kubernetes) Understand your Kubernetes spend alongside total spend across containerized and non-containerized environments.
- [FinOps And Financial Reporting](https://www.cloudzero.com/tour/finops) Operationalize reporting on metrics such as cost per customer, COGS, gross margin. Forecast spend, reconcile invoices and easily investigate variance.
- [Engineering Accountability](https://www.cloudzero.com/tour/engineering) Foster a cost-conscious culture, where engineers understand spend, proactively consider cost, and get immediate feedback with fewer interruptions and faster and more efficient innovation.
- [Optimization And Reducing Waste](https://www.cloudzero.com/tour/optimization) Focus on immediately reducing spend by understanding where we have waste, inefficiencies, and discounting opportunities.
