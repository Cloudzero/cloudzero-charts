Here's a markdown-formatted document that describes the behavior of the Helm chart and its Jobs.

# **Helm Chart Job Execution and Upgrade Behavior**

This document outlines the expected behavior of the **Helm chart Jobs** under different upgrade scenarios, including version upgrades and forced upgrades (`--force`).

## **Jobs Overview**
The Helm chart deploys two Jobs:  
- **`backfill`**: Runs during every version upgrade or container image change. It ensures current state of the cluster is captured.  
- **`init-cert`**: Generates or renews the internal certificates needed for communication between Kubernetes and the webhook server.

## **Upgrade Scenarios and Job Behavior**
| Upgrade Scenario            | `backfill` Job Behavior | `init-cert` Job Behavior |
|-----------------------------|------------------------|--------------------------|
| **Standard version upgrade** | Runs on every version/image upgrade | Runs every upgrade but only generates a certificate if needed |
| **Forced upgrade (`--force`)** | Runs again after the Job is automatically deleted | Always runs and ensures a new certificate is created |
| **Upgrade Without Chart Version Change** | Does not run | Runs again, but does not regenerate certificate |

---
## **Common Issues & Troubleshooting**
### **Issue: Forced Upgrade (`--force`) Fails Due to Running `backfill` Job**
**Problem:**  
- If a **forced upgrade (`--force`)** is triggered while the **previous `backfill` Job is still running**, the upgrade will fail.
- This happens because **Kubernetes Jobs are immutable**â€”Helm cannot replace an existing running Job.
- The error in this case may include a message similar to:
```sh
Error: UPGRADE FAILED: failed to replace object: Job.batch "cloudzero-agent-backfill"
```
**Solution:**  
1. **Wait for the `backfill` Job to complete**  
   - The Job will be **automatically deleted after 60 seconds** (`ttlSecondsAfterFinished`).
   - Once the Job is removed, retry the Helm upgrade.

2. **Manually delete the running Job and retry the upgrade**  
   ```sh
   kubectl delete job -n <NAMESPACE> -l app.kubernetes.io/component=webhook-server
   helm upgrade --install <RELEASE_NAME> cloudzero/cloudzero-agent -n <NAMESPACE> --version <version> --force
   ```
   - This immediately removes all initialization Jobs, allowing Helm to recreate them.

## **Implementation Notes**
1. **`backfill` Job Cleanup:** The Job includes a `ttlSecondsAfterFinished: 60` to automatically remove itself.
2. **`init-cert` Job Cleanup:** Uses `ttlSecondsAfterFinished: 3600` for cleanup.
3. **Deployment Rollout:** The `init-cert` Job includes a mechanism to force a Deployment restart when it completes.
