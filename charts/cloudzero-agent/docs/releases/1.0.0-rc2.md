## [Release 1.0.0-rc2](https://github.com/Cloudzero/cloudzero-charts/compare/v1.0.0-rc1...v1.0.0-rc2) (2025-02-12)

This release fixes an issue in which the internal TLS certificate could create a SAN field with an incorrect service address.

### Upgrade Steps
Upgrade using the following command:
```console
helm upgrade --install <RELEASE_NAME> cloudzero/cloudzero-agent -n <NAMESPACE> --create-namespace -f configuration.example.yaml --version 1.0.0-rc2
```

#### Bug Fixes
* **SAN Field Properly Formatted:** Previously, users installing the agent in a non-`default` namespace who were also using the internal TLS certificate generation may have run into an issue in which the certificate is improperly generated. The template now takes the release namespace into account.
