## [1.1.1](https://github.com/Cloudzero/cloudzero-agent/compare/v1.1.0...v1.1.1) (2025-05-02)

This is a maintenance release which is primarily aimed at expanding compatibility.

### Key Features

- **Reduce Kubernetes requirement from 1.23 to 1.21**: This expands the number of clusters the agent can be installed on all the way back to Kubernetes versions which have been EOL since mid-2022.
- **Remove patch permission on deployments in certificate initialization job**: The init cert job no longer requires the patch permission on deployments, enabling installation in more restrictive environments.

### Notable Bug Fixes

- **Recursively create subdirectory in shipper**: Previously, if the shipper container was restarted without restarting the entire pod, it would fail due to the parent of a directory it was trying to create not existing. With this version the parent directory will be created automatically.
- **Assorted dependency updates**
