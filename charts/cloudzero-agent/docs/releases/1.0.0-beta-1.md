### Bug Fixes
* **Remove Duplicate Service Account Name:** Removes a duplicate entry for Service Account used by the server Deployment.

### Improvements
* **Increase default replica count for insights-controller server:** Increases the default replica count from 1 to 3 for high availability.
* **Initialization Job Uses Chart Service Account:** The `init-job` now uses the Service Account created in this chart instead of the default Service Account, which is required by some security policies.
