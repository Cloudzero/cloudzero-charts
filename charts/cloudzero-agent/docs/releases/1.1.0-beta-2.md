## [1.1.0-beta-2](https://github.com/Cloudzero/cloudzero-insights-controller/compare/1.1.0-beta-1...1.1.0-beta-2) (2025-03-28)

This release fixes several issues with the CloudZero Aggregator and improves
documentation, usability, observability.

### Upgrade Steps

- Upgrade with:

```sh
helm upgrade --install <RELEASE_NAME> cloudzero-beta/cloudzero-agent -n <NAMESPACE> --create-namespace -f configuration.example.yaml --devel --version 1.1.0-beta-2
```

See the [beta installation instructions](https://github.com/Cloudzero/cloudzero-charts/blob/develop/charts/cloudzero-agent/BETA-INSTALLATION.md) for further detail

### Bug Fixes

- **Direct metrics from Insights Controller to Aggregator:** Previously, the
  Insights Controller would send data directly to the CloudZero API instead of
  to the Collector.
- **Allow additional metric labels:** Several labels which were previously
  filtered out by the Collector are now allowed, most notably `provider_id`.

### Improvements

- **Update Insights Controller to 0.2.1:** This release includes a number of
  enhancements and fixes.
- **Support custom resources for validator initContainer resources:**
  User-supplied validator.resources are now applied to the initContainer for the
  CloudZero Agent. Thanks to Anna Winnick for the contribution!
- **Improve documentation clarity:** the README is now more explicitly about
  what versions support labels and annotations via the Insights Controller.
