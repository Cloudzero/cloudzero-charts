## [1.1.0-beta-1](https://github.com/Cloudzero/cloudzero-insights-controller/compare/1.0.1...1.1.0-beta-1) (2025-03-18)

Initial (beta) release of the new CloudZero Aggregator.

### Upgrade Steps
* Upgrade with:
```sh
helm upgrade --install -n cloudzero-agent cloudzero-beta -f configuration-example.yaml
```
See the [beta installation instructions](https://github.com/Cloudzero/cloudzero-charts/blob/develop/charts/cloudzero-agent/BETA-INSTALLATION.md) for further detail

### Bug Fixes

* **Update nodeSelector settings:** The nodeSelector is now available for the `initCertJob` and `initBackfillJob` jobs.
* **nodeSelector, tolerations, and affiinity settings moved:** These settings have now moved to the `insightsController.server` section.

### Improvements

* **CloudZero Aggregator:** The CloudZero Aggregator (affectionately known as "The Gator") is a new component that sits between the CloudZero Agent and the CloudZero Platform. The Gator aggregates metrics into a local cache before sending them in larger batches to the CloudZero Platform. This provides substantial improvements in reliability, performance, disaster recovery, user-friendliness, and more.
* **Reduce scrape interval:**: The scrape interval was previously set to every 2 minutes, this has been reduced to every 1 minute.
