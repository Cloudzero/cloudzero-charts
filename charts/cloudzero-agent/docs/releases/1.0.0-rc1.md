## [Release 1.0.0-rc1](https://github.com/Cloudzero/cloudzero-agent/compare/v0.0.28...v1.0.0-rc1) (2025-01-23)

This release changes the name of the initialization Job that gathers information about existing state of a cluster. The name of the Job now includes the version of the chart and the image tag used in the Pod.

Additionally, the `initScrapeJob` field is deprecated in favor of `initBackfillJob`. However, this is not a breaking change; `initScrapeJob` can still be used without issue.

### Upgrade Steps
Optionally rename the `initScrapeJob` field in any override files with `initBackfillJob`. `initBackfillJob` is the preferred field, but configurations using `initScrapeJob` will still work.

Upgrade using the following command:
```console
helm upgrade --install <RELEASE_NAME> cloudzero-beta/cloudzero-agent -n <NAMESPACE> --create-namespace -f configuration.example.yaml --version 1.0.0-rc1
```

### Improvements
* **Initialization Job Name Changes With Releases:** It was previously possible to have failures in release upgrades if the container image used in the Job changed. This is because the `image` field in a Job spec is immutable. To prevent this, a new Job is created every time the Helm chart version is changed and/or when the image used in the Job is changed. This also ensures that changes to the underlying `insights-controller` application will be used in the new backfill of existing cluster state data.

* **Clarified Field Names:** The Job used for gathering existing cluster data was previously controlled via a field named `initScrapeJob`. This is an overloaded term given that this chart also uses the term "scrape job" in the context of Prometheus. This has caused some confusion, so the field is now renamed to `initBackfillJob`. `initScrapeJob` is still usable, and values from `initScrapeJob` are merged with `initBackfillJob` with the latter having precedence.
