## [Release 1.0.0-beta-10](https://github.com/Cloudzero/cloudzero-agent/compare/v0.0.28...v1.0.0-beta-10) (2025-01-17)

This release adds logic to ensure that static target used in the `env-validator` and the Prometheus configuration always match the internal Service created by the `kube-state-metrics` subchart.

### Upgrade Steps
Upgrade using the following command:
```console
helm upgrade --install <RELEASE_NAME> cloudzero-beta/cloudzero-agent -n <NAMESPACE> --create-namespace -f configuration.example.yaml --version 1.0.0-beta-10
```

### Improvements
* **Static Target and KSM Service Alway Match:** Both the `env-validator` and the Prometheus agent require an address for a `kube-state-metrics` Service. By default, the Service name generated by the `kube-state-metrics` subchart generates a name that matches the target value generated by the chart.

However, if the user overrides the name of the `kube-state-metrics` Service using `kubeStateMetrics.fullnameOverride`, there can be a mismatch between the names. This change attempts to mirror the logic used by the internal `kube-state-metrics` chart so that the target and Service names will match regardless of user input.
