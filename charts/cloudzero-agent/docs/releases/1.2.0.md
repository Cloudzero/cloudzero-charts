## [1.2.0](https://github.com/Cloudzero/cloudzero-agent/compare/v1.1.2...v1.2.0) (2025-06-05)

Release 1.2.0 introduces **Federated Mode** support, comprehensive **Helm Schema Validation**, enhanced **Configuration Management**, and numerous improvements to observability, reliability, and maintainability. This release significantly expands deployment flexibility while strengthening data quality and operational efficiency.

### Key Features

- **Federated Mode Support**: The CloudZero agent now supports federated mode deployment to help support large clusters. In this mode, the Agent runs on each node in the cluster instead of a single Agent for all nodes. To enable, set `defaults.federation.enabled` to `true`.
- **Comprehensive Helm Schema Validation**: We have extended the JSON Schema validation to cover the entire configuration, providing much earlier feedback of any issues.
- **New "helmless" tool**: We have added a new "cloudzero-helmless" tool, which can be used to show the minimal difference between the default configuration and the configuration as used in the chart installation. This effectively recreates a minimized overrides overrides file.

### Additional Enhancements

- **Improved Load Balancing**: Enhanced HTTP connection handling with periodic connection rotation to ensure proper load distribution across service replicas in multi-replica deployments.
- **Observability and Debugging**: Enhanced logging with configurable Prometheus log levels, and reduced log noise by moving health checks to trace level.
- **Security and Reliability**: Added default Pod Disruption Budgets for improved availability.
- **Configuration ConfigMap**: We now create a ConfigMap with the entire Helm chart configuration, to make debugging much easier.
- **Reduced storage usage**: By default, we now store metric files on the aggregator for 7 days instead of 90, significantly reducing storage requirements.

### Notable Bug Fixes

- **Eliminate unnecessary replays**: Fixed an issue in the shipper which could cause the shipper to replay files repeatedly, instead of once, after receiving a request to replay a file.
- **Allow out-of-order metrics**: In some (relatively rare) cases, we were seeing metrics being dropped as they were arriving out of order. There is now a configuration option for setting a window where they will still be accepted, which defaults to 5 minutes.

### Upgrade Steps

To upgrade to version 1.2.0, run the following command:

```sh
helm upgrade --install <RELEASE_NAME> cloudzero/cloudzero-agent -n <NAMESPACE> --create-namespace -f configuration.example.yaml --version 1.2.0
```
