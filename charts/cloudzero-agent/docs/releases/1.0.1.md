## [Release 1.0.1](https://github.com/Cloudzero/cloudzero-charts/compare/1.0.0...1.0.1) (2025-03-02)

This release fixes two issues relating to template rendering and TLS certificate generation, as well as adding documentation for Istio enabled clusters.

### Upgrade Steps
Upgrade using the following command:
```console
helm upgrade --install <RELEASE_NAME> cloudzero-beta/cloudzero-agent -n <NAMESPACE> --create-namespace -f configuration.example.yaml --version 1.0.1
```

### Bug Fixes
* **Webhook Resource Names Trimmed Appropriately:** Fixes an issue in which the name used by webhook resources adds a suffix after trimming, which can potentially allow resource names that violate Kubernetes naming rules.
* **Certificate Generation Runs For All Webhook Configuration Changes:** Fixes an issue in which the TLS certificate generation initialization Job does not run if a `ValidatingWebhookConfiguration` is created after initial installation.

### Improvements
* **Shorter TTL for `init-cert` Job:** The `init-cert` Job is now cleaned up after 5 seconds, so that repeated installations regenerate certificates as needed.
