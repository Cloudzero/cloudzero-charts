## [1.0.0-beta-5](https://github.com/Cloudzero/cloudzero-agent/compare/v1.0.1-beta...v1.0.0-beta-5) (2024-12-12)

The following new features are available in this version of the Beta Chart release:

* **Automatic detection and reconfiguration of secrets rotation.**
* **Automatic detection and reconfiguration of TLS Certificate rotation.**

### Upgrade Steps
* Upgrade with:
```sh
helm upgrade --install <RELEASE_NAME> cloudzero-beta/cloudzero-agent -n <NAMESPACE> --create-namespace -f configuration.example.yaml --version 1.0.0-beta-5
```
For more details, see the [beta installation instructions](https://github.com/Cloudzero/cloudzero-charts/blob/develop/charts/cloudzero-agent/BETA-INSTALLATION.md).

### Improvements

* **Availability Enhancement**: Healthcheck support ensures that requests are only forwarded to replica instances that are ready to accept work.
* **Security Policy Enhancements**: The application can now react to changes in the Cloudzero API Secret or TLS Certificates. In production environments, these secret values will rotate and update periodically. Instead of restarting the service, which can be costly, the application can now react to key changes and reinitialize the related layer.
