## [1.1.0](https://github.com/Cloudzero/cloudzero-agent/compare/v1.0.3...v1.1.0) (2025-04-29)

Release 1.1.0 introduces the **CloudZero Aggregator**, a high-performance, cost-efficient replacement for the CloudZero OLTP metrics API. This release also includes numerous enhancements and fixes to improve functionality and user experience.

### Key Features

#### **CloudZero Aggregator**

The CloudZero Aggregator is a local collector application designed to enhance telemetry processing and resilience. Key benefits include:

- **End-to-End Telemetry Tracking**: Ensures complete visibility and traceability of telemetry files.
- **Resilience During Key Rotation**: Enables seamless API key rotation with the new **CloudZero Multiple API Key** feature. The aggregator collects data and uploads it directly to your organization's dedicated S3 bucket, allowing key updates in the secret store without requiring redeployment. Each customer is assigned a unique bucket within our SaaS platform, ensuring robust data isolation and security.
- **Improved Onboarding Feedback**: Provides faster feedback on deployment configurations, typically within 10 minutes.
- **Configurable Upload Intervals**: Offers flexibility with upload intervals, defaulting to 10 minutes, to suit your operational needs.

This design ensures robust data collection and faster troubleshooting, reducing downtime and improving operational efficiency.

### Additional Enhancements

This release introduces several improvements aimed at enhancing reliability, performance, and ease of use for the CloudZero agent:

- **New Configuration API in Helm Values/Overrides**: Simplifies Helm chart customization with a minimalistic configuration API, ensuring future compatibility. Users can configure images, labels, annotations, tolerations, affinities, node selectors, priority classes, and DNS settings.
- **Improved Scrape Frequency**: Metrics are now captured every 1 minute instead of 2, delivering greater monitoring granularity and faster, more actionable insights.
- **Improved Disk Management**: Added configurable disk monitoring options and enhanced disk space management for optimal performance.
- **Enhanced HTTP Error Logging**: Improved logging for HTTP errors, making debugging and monitoring more efficient.
- **Automatic DNS Configuration**: Automatically generates DNS configuration and priority class settings, streamlining deployment and reducing manual effort.
- **Improved Labeling and Annotations**: Consolidated multiple Kubernetes validating webhooks into a single webhook, reducing complexity and ensuring consistency across resources.
- **Enhanced Debug Logging**: Introduced debug logging for abandoned file IDs in the shipper component, aiding in issue resolution.
- **Single Binary and Single Version**: Unified CloudZero image reference, tagged to match the chart release, simplifying image mirroring, versioning, and operational identification.
- **Pod Disruption Budgets**: Added to ensure higher availability and stability during maintenance or unexpected disruptions.
- **Comprehensive Documentation**: Added detailed guidance for required API scopes for the Kubernetes agent, ensuring smoother onboarding and configuration.
- **Improved Labels and Annotations Backfill Performance**: Enhanced performance for backfilling labels and annotations, ensuring faster and more efficient processing.

These enhancements collectively represent a significant step forward in the functionality and usability of the CloudZero agent.

### Upgrade Steps

To upgrade, run the following command:

```sh
helm upgrade --install <RELEASE_NAME> cloudzero/cloudzero-agent -n <NAMESPACE> --create-namespace -f configuration.example.yaml --version 1.1.0
```

### Bug Fixes

- **Duplicate Affinity in Insights Deployment**: Resolved an issue where affinity settings were being duplicated in the insights deployment configuration.
- **Validation Improvement**: Improved validation and check results output.
- **Agent Termination**: Fixed a hang issue during agent termination in redeployments.
