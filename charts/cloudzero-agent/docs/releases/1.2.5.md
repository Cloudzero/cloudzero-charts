## [1.2.5](https://github.com/Cloudzero/cloudzero-agent/compare/v1.2.4...v1.2.5) (2025-07-25)

Release 1.2.5 is a **critical maintenance release** that fixes a webhook configuration issue affecting resource metadata collection. Due to a single-character difference in resource names (using singular instead of plural), the webhook server was not collecting the necessary information for labels and annotations. **Customers on versions 1.2.3 and 1.2.4 should upgrade immediately.**

### Critical Fix

- **Webhook Configuration Fix**: Fixed a critical bug where the webhook server was not collecting resource metadata due to incorrect resource name configuration. This affected label and annotation collection for all resources processed by the webhook.

### Key Features

- **Enhanced Webhook Configuration**: Fixed webhook misconfiguration issues and improved integration testing infrastructure with comprehensive validation and debugging capabilities.
- **AWS IMDSv1 Fallback Support**: The CloudZero Agent's AWS scout implementation now gracefully falls back from IMDSv2 to IMDSv1 when the token endpoint is unavailable, ensuring compatibility with clusters that don't have IMDSv2 enabled. This maintains security preference for IMDSv2 while providing compatibility with IMDSv1-only environments.
- **Comprehensive Troubleshooting Guide**: Added a troubleshooting guide covering quick diagnosis, component-specific troubleshooting, network policies, certificate issues, and scaling problems with clear escalation paths.

### Additional Enhancements

- **Security Documentation**: Significantly expanded SECURITY.md with detailed security considerations, vulnerability reporting procedures, and best practices for secure deployment.
- **Scout Error Messages**: Enhanced scout configuration error messages with specific Helm chart parameter guidance, making troubleshooting more actionable.
- **Cloud Provider Detection**: Added cloud provider information to cluster configuration for improved metadata collection and environment awareness.
- **Test Infrastructure**: Improved webhook integration testing with centralized Kind cluster configuration, enhanced test maintainability, and comprehensive validation.
- **Dependency Updates**: All third-party dependencies have been update to the latest versions.

### Technical Improvements

- **Webhook Reliability**: Fixed service name resolution and improved webhook test validation with comprehensive debugging capabilities
- **Documentation Quality**: Added systematic troubleshooting approach with label selector commands and component-specific diagnostic procedures
- **Build System**: Enhanced test infrastructure with better organization and maintainability
- **AWS Metadata Service Compatibility**: Implemented robust fallback mechanism for AWS metadata retrieval with clear error distinction between IMDSv2 and IMDSv1 failures

### Upgrade Steps

**⚠️ CRITICAL: Customers on versions 1.2.3 and 1.2.4 should upgrade immediately due to the webhook configuration fix.**
