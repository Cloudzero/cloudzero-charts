## [1.2.1](https://github.com/Cloudzero/cloudzero-agent/compare/v1.2.0...v1.2.1) (2025-06-17)

This is primarily a bugfix release that resolves JSON Schema validation issues when the cloudzero-agent Helm chart is used as a subchart.

### Bug Fixes

- **Subchart Schema Validation**: Fixed JSON Schema validation error that occurred when the cloudzero-agent chart was used as a subchart. Helm automatically adds a top-level 'global' property for subcharts, which was not previously allowed by the schema, causing validation failures.

### Additional Enhancements

- **Helmless Job**: Added a Helm job that runs the helmless tool, providing an easy way to determine minimal configuration overrides by checking the job logs.
- **Improved Logging**: Both the collector and shipper now emit regular info-level log messages, providing positive confirmation that the agent is working correctly.

### Testing Improvements

- **Subchart Testing**: Added comprehensive test coverage for subchart scenarios to prevent regression of schema validation issues.

### Upgrade Steps

To upgrade to version 1.2.1, run the following command:

```sh
helm upgrade --install <RELEASE_NAME> cloudzero/cloudzero-agent -n <NAMESPACE> --create-namespace -f configuration.example.yaml --version 1.2.1
```
