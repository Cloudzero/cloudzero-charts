## [Release 1.0.2](https://github.com/Cloudzero/cloudzero-charts/compare/1.0.1...1.0.2) (2025-03-18)

This release fixes an issue with helm chart templating, as well as makes an improvement to the sampling rate of the Prometheus agent.

### Upgrade Steps
Upgrade using the following command:
```console
helm upgrade --install <RELEASE_NAME> cloudzero/cloudzero-agent -n <NAMESPACE> --create-namespace -f configuration.example.yaml --version 1.0.2
```

### Bug Fixes
* **Node Scheduling Settings Fixed:** Fixes an issue in which the `initCertJob` did not have the option to set `nodeSelector`, `affinity`, or `tolerations`. Additionally, these settings can now be set for each initialization Job individually.
* **Values File Documentation Fixed:** Fixes an issue in which the node scheduling settings for the `insightsController` were indented to the wrong level.

### Improvements
* **Default Scrape Interval Set to 60s:** The default `scrape_interval` setting used by the internal Prometheus agent is updated from `120s` to `60s`. This improvement makes it more likely that the agent captures usage information for short-lived pods.
