## [Release 1.0.0-beta-6](https://github.com/Cloudzero/cloudzero-agent/compare/v0.0.28...v1.0.0-beta-6) (2024-12-23)

This release introduces native Kubernetes **Labels** and **Annotations** support to the CloudZero platform. You can now identify Kubernetes **dimensions** based on the Labels and Annotations used in your Kubernetes deployments.

### New Features

- **Kubernetes Labels and Annotations**: Enhance your ability to categorize and manage resources by leveraging Labels and Annotations directly within the CloudZero platform.

### Configuration Changes

To take advantage of these new features, update your Helm chart configuration as outlined below.

#### Example `example-override-values.yaml` File:

```yaml
# -- UNCHANGED: Cloud Service Provider Account ID
#    This must be a string - even if it is a number in your system.
#    Adding a new line here is an easy workaround.
cloudAccountId: |-
  null

# -- UNCHANGED: The Cluster name
clusterName: null

# -- UNCHANGED: The Cloud Service Provider Region
region: null

# -- UNCHANGED: CloudZero API key. Required if existingSecretName is null.
apiKey: null

# -- UNCHANGED: If set, the agent will use the API key in this Secret to authenticate with CloudZero.
existingSecretName: null

# -- NEW: Flag to deploy the Jetstack.io "cert-manager". Most environments will already have this deployed,
#    so set this to "false" if applicable. Otherwise, enabling this to "true" is a quick way to get started.
#    See the README for more information.
cert-manager:
  # -- DEFAULT: enabled.
  enabled: true | false

# -- NEW: Service Account used for the Insights Controller
#    The account is required. If you already have an existing account, set the name in the field below.
serviceAccount:
  # -- DEFAULT: create the service account.
  create: true | false
  name: ""
  annotations: {}

# -- NEW: Label and Annotation Configuration
insightsController:
  # -- By default, a ValidatingAdmissionWebhook will be deployed to record all created labels and annotations.
  enabled: true | false
  labels:
    # -- DEFAULT: enabled.
    enabled: true | false
    # -- This value MUST be set to a list of regular expressions used to gather labels from pods,
    #    deployments, statefulsets, daemonsets, cronjobs, jobs, nodes, and namespaces.
    patterns:
      # List of Go-style regular expressions used to filter desired labels.
      # Caution: The CloudZero system has a limit of 300 labels and annotations,
      # so it is advisable to provide a specific list of required labels.
      - '.*'
  annotations:
    # -- DEFAULT: disabled.
    enabled: true | false
    patterns:
      # List of Go-style regular expressions used to filter desired annotations.
      # Caution: The CloudZero system has a limit of 300 labels and annotations,
      # so it is advisable to provide a specific list of required annotations.
      - '.*'
```

### Upgrade Instructions

If you have an existing CloudZero Agent deployment, follow these steps to upgrade:

1. **Define the `values.yaml` Override Configuration**:
   
   Ensure your `values.yaml` override configuration includes the new settings outlined above. Note that some existing values may no longer be necessary.

2. **Update the Helm Chart Repository**:
   
   ```sh
   helm repo add cloudzero https://cloudzero.github.io/cloudzero-charts
   helm repo update
   ```

3. **Upgrade the Deployment**:
   
   ```sh
   helm upgrade --install <YOUR_RELEASE_NAME> -n <YOUR_NAMESPACE> cloudzero -f override-values.yaml
   ```
   
   > **Replace** `<YOUR_RELEASE_NAME>` with the name you used to release the chart into your environment.
   >
   > **Replace** `<YOUR_NAMESPACE>` with the namespace you used for your deployment.

### Deprecations and Breaking Changes

1. **`node-exporter` Deprecation**:
   
   The `node-exporter` has been deprecated and is no longer used.

2. **External `kube-state-metrics` Deprecation**:
   
   External `kube-state-metrics` has been deprecated. We now deploy an instance within the CloudZero Agent deployment named `cloudzero-state-metrics`, which is not discoverable by other monitoring platforms and ensures the necessary configuration is defined for telemetry collection requirements. If you host the images in a private image repository, you can override the following in the `values.yaml` file:

   ```yaml
   kubeStateMetrics:
     image:
       registry: registry.k8s.io
       repository: kube-state-metrics/kube-state-metrics
   ```

3. **API Key Management Argument Relocation**:
   
   - API key management arguments have moved to the `global` section.
   - Previously, you could pass an `apiKey` or `existingSecretName` argument directly to the chart.
   - These arguments should now be passed as `global.apiKey` and `global.existingSecretName`, respectively.

### Summary of Changes:

1. **Typos and Grammar**:
   - Corrected "Annotaitons" to "Annotations".
   - Ensured consistent use of "Go-style" instead of "golang style".

2. **Clarity and Consistency**:
   - Enhanced section headings for better readability.
   - Clarified comments within the YAML example for better understanding.
   - Ensured consistent capitalization of terms like "Labels" and "Annotations".

3. **Formatting**:
   - Fixed indentation in the `kubeStateMetrics` YAML snippet.
   - Improved bullet points and indentation for better visual structure.
   - Ensured code blocks and commands are clearly separated from the text.

4. **Additional Notes**:
