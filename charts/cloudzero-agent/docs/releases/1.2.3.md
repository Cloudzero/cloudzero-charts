## [1.2.3](https://github.com/Cloudzero/cloudzero-agent/compare/v1.2.2...v1.2.3) (2025-07-02)

Release 1.2.3 introduces **Cloud Service Provider Auto-Detection**, significant **Performance Optimizations** for the admission controller, enhanced **Istio Integration**, and numerous reliability improvements. This release dramatically simplifies deployment configuration while improving performance and compatibility with service mesh environments.

### Key Features

- **Cloud Service Provider Auto-Detection**: The CloudZero agent now includes a comprehensive "scout" system that automatically detects cloud environment metadata including provider, region, account ID, and cluster name. This eliminates the need to manually configure these values in many deployments.
  - **AWS Support**: Automatically detects region, account ID from EC2 instance metadata
  - **Google Cloud Support**: Automatically detects region, project ID, and cluster name from GCE metadata
  - **Azure Support**: Automatically detects region and subscription ID from Azure IMDS
- **Webhook Server Optimization**: The webhook server now explicitly requests only the Kubernetes resource types it needs instead of receiving all resources, significantly reducing network traffic and improving performance.
- **Enhanced Istio Integration**: The webhook server now automatically includes `sidecar.istio.io/inject: "false"` annotation by default, providing seamless out-of-the-box compatibility with Istio service mesh environments without requiring manual configuration.

### Additional Enhancements

- **Improved Load Balancing**: Enhanced webhook server connection handling with periodic connection rotation to ensure proper load distribution across service replicas in multi-replica deployments.
- **Configurable Webhook Timeout**: Added ability to configure webhook admission controller timeout values, and changed the default from 15 seconds to 1 second.

### Upgrade Steps

To upgrade to version 1.2.3, run the following command:

```sh
helm upgrade --install <RELEASE_NAME> cloudzero/cloudzero-agent -n <NAMESPACE> --create-namespace -f configuration.example.yaml --version 1.2.3
```
