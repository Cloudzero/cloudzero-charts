## [1.2.2](https://github.com/Cloudzero/cloudzero-agent/compare/v1.2.1...v1.2.2) (2025-06-24)

This is a maintenance release that includes important bug fixes and dependency updates to improve reliability and stability.

### Bug Fixes

- **Configuration Management**: Fixed an issue where component-specific configuration merging was incorrectly modifying default values, potentially causing unexpected behavior.
- **ConfigMap References**: Updated ConfigMap name references in the loader job to use the correct naming convention, preventing resource lookup failures.
- **JSON Schema Validation**: Added support for properties which were previously not present in `values.yaml`, but were used in the template.
- **Invalid Template Fixes**: Fixed template generation for options were causing invalid Kubernetes resources to be generated.

### Enhancements

- **Helmless Tool**: Improved the helmless implementation by splitting it out from the CLI with enhanced testing coverage and removal of unnecessary functionality.
- **Testing Infrastructure**: Added checks to verify that all Kubernetes resources are created successfully during deployment validation.
- **Testing Template Generation**: Added kubeconform tests to validate generated templates.
