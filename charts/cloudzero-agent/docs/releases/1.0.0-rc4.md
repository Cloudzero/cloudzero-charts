## [Release 1.0.0-rc4](https://github.com/Cloudzero/cloudzero-agent/compare/v1.0.0-rc3...v1.0.0-rc4) (2025-02-16)

This release makes improvements to the certificate initialization Job so that more invalid states can be rectified. Additionally, annotations can now be added to initialization Jobs. Expiration of both initialization Jobs is not configurable.

### Upgrade Steps

Upgrade using the following command:
```console
helm upgrade --install <RELEASE_NAME> cloudzero/cloudzero-agent -n <NAMESPACE> --create-namespace -f configuration.example.yaml --version 1.0.0-rc4
```

See [upgrades.md](../upgrades.md) for full documentation of upgrade behavior as it relates to initialization Jobs.

### Improvements
* **Certificate Initialization Job Checks For More Invalid Conditions:** The certificate initialization job now checks for certificates with invalid SAN settings, mismatches between webhook configurations, and mismatches between the webhook `caBundle` value and the `ca.crt` value in the TLS secret.

* **Automatic Job Cleanup Configuration:** TTL for both initialization Jobs is now configurable, and defaults to 180 seconds.

* **Initialization Job Annotation Support:** Both initialization Jobs allow the user to set annotations. This was specifically added to make management via ArgoCD easier, as ArgoCD will consider expired Jobs to be OutOfSync with the release source. See [upgrades.md](../upgrades.md) for details on recommended annotations.
