## [1.2.4](https://github.com/Cloudzero/cloudzero-agent/compare/v1.2.3...v1.2.4) (2025-07-17)

**⚠️ CRITICAL: This version contains a webhook configuration bug that prevents proper resource metadata collection. Please upgrade to version 1.2.5 immediately.**

Release 1.2.4 is a maintenance release including **Improved Metrics Filtering**, and **Collector Interval Adjustments** for better performance. This release focuses on operational improvements, build efficiency, and enhanced visibility into metric processing.

### Key Features

- **Optimized Collection Intervals**: Increased cost metrics collection interval from 10 minutes to 30 minutes for better performance in smaller clusters, while reducing observability metrics timeout to 10 minutes to maintain cluster connectivity visibility.
- **Enhanced Scout Auto-Detection**: The confload job now leverages the Scout system to automatically detect cloud environment metadata (region, account ID, cluster name) when these values are not explicitly provided, significantly simplifying deployment configuration.
- **Dramatic Docker Build Performance**: Build times reduced from 2:30-3:00 minutes to ~12 seconds through multi-stage builds with platform-specific caching, selective file copying, and conditional dependency generation.
- **Dropped Metrics Tracking**: The metric filter now provides visibility into filtered-out metrics through debug logging, making it easier to debug filter configurations and understand metric processing behavior.

### Additional Enhancements

- **Backfiller Reliability**: Fixed GroupVersionKind issues and race conditions in namespace and node processing, with comprehensive integration testing.
- **Test Infrastructure**: Improved test reliability by fixing flaky tests related to file monitoring, file locking, and SQL timestamp formatting.
- **Development Tooling**: Added semantic diff targets (`*.{yaml,json}-semdiff`) for better visibility into Helm template changes during development.
- **Dependency Management**: Updated Dependabot to run on Wednesdays instead of Fridays for better alignment with patch release cycles.

### Upgrade Steps

To upgrade to version 1.2.4, run the following command:

```sh
helm upgrade --install <RELEASE_NAME> cloudzero/cloudzero-agent -n <NAMESPACE> --create-namespace -f configuration.example.yaml --version 1.2.4
```
