# Validating the Deployment

This guide provides instructions on how to validate the deployment of the Helm chart and identify common problems. It outlines how to use the environment validation container to gather insight into issues post deployment.

## Step by Step

### 1. Get the pod names for the deployment

To retrieve the pod names for the deployment, use the following command:

```sh
kubectl -n cloudzero-agent get pods
```

> Note: Replace `cloudzero-agent` with the correct namespace for your deployment.

### 2. Identify the correct pod name

To inspect the logs of the `env-validator` container, you need to identify the pod name for the `cloudzero-agent-server` pod.

### 3. Read the logs for the `env-validator` container

Using the pod name obtained in step 2, run the following command:

```sh
kubectl -n cloudzero-agent logs -f -c env-validator <pod_name>
```
> Note: The `-f` flag is used to follow the logs, and the `-c env-validator` flag is used to read the logs of the specific container.

Diagnostics are run at 3 lifecycle phases of the `cloudzero-agent` pod deployment:

1. `Pod initialization` - basic configuration elements are validated, such as the API key and egress reachability.
2. `Post pod start` - the prometheus container runs the `post-start` checks, then posts a `cluster up` status to the Cloudzero API. Checks include validating the API key, capturing the Kubernetes version, inspecting the scrape configuration, checking the kube-state-metrics service, and the prometheus-node-exporter server reachability. The results are logged to the `/prometheus/cloudzero-validator.log` file in the container.
3. `Pre pod stop` - the prometheus container runs the `pre-stop` checks (usually none), then posts a `cluster down` status to the Cloudzero API.

Based on the above statements, it is also possible to diagnose from the perspective of the prometheus container. To inspect the logs, use the following command, replacing the pod name with that of your current deployment:

```sh
kubectl -n $NS exec -ti -c cloudzero-agent-server cloudzero-agent-server-766b4865dc-nrwc5 -- sh -c 'cat cloudzero-agent-validator.log'
```

> Remember to use the correct namespace and pod identity.

### 4. Interpret the Results

In the screenshot above, notice the `checks` section. This section allows you to view the results of the configured checks. For any checks that are not passing, an error message will be captured to help diagnose the problem.

## Troubleshooting

The Cloudlock Agent has the following requirements:

1. It must be able to communicate with the `Kubernetes metrics server`.
2. It must be able to communicate with the `Prometheus node exporter`.
3. It must be provided with a valid Cloudzero API Token.
4. It must be able to communicate with the Cloudzero API to send metrics.
5. It must be configured to collect the correct metrics and labels to the Cloudzero API.

Based on these 5 requirements, the checks have been designed to help identify problems quickly during a new deployment. Using the tool, and log output, it should be possible to confirm this information with Cloudzero support.
