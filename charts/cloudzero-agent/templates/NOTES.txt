****WARNING****

This chart has been installed with both `kubeStateMetrics.targetOverride` and `kubeStateMetrics.enabled`. This is almost certainly not a correct configuration.

The purpose of targetOverride is for you to bring your own kube-state-metrics. If `kubeStateMetrics.enabled` is true, and `kubeStateMetrics.targetOverride` is not null, 
it is likely you will not receive the required metrics and data in the CloudZero platform since the agent may be looking for the wrong service address for KSM.

Please refer to the documentation for guidance on `kubeStateMetrics` settings.
